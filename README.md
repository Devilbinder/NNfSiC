# Neural Networks from Scratch in `C`

The idea here is to share [Neural Networks from Scratch tutorial parts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) / [Neural Networks from Scratch book](https://nnfs.io) in C.

Creating this as the [NNfSiX repo](https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX) does not get updated regularly. I will be adding corrections here as they get mention in the [NNfSiX repo](https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX).

Also created a library version here as it is not allowed on the [NNfSiX repo](https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX) to use multiple files.
